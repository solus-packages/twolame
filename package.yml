description: |
    TwoLAME is an optimized MPEG Audio Layer 2 (MP2) encoder. It is based heavily on tooLAME by Michael Cheng, the ISO dist10 code and improvements to algorithms as part of the LAME project.

    TwoLAME should be able to be used as a drop-in replacement for LAME (a MPEG Layer 3 encoder). The frontend takes very similar command line options to LAME, and the backend library has a very similar API to LAME.
